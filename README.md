# What is Azure?

Azure is microsoft Cloud computing platform.

Azure supports platform softare and infrastructure as service.

- Azure container and Kubernetes is a thing.

- Be ready for the future: Continuous innovation from Microsoft supports your development today and your product visions for tomorrow.

- Build on your terms: You have choices. With a commitment to open source, and support for all languages and frameworks, you can build how you want and deploy where you want to.

- Operate hybrid seamlessly: On-premises, in the cloud, and at the edge--we'll meet you where you are. Integrate and manage your environments with tools and services designed for a hybrid cloud solution.

- Trust your cloud: Get security from the ground up, backed by a team of experts, and proactive compliance trusted by enterprises, governments, and startups.

### How does it work?

It uses virtualization to decouple OS from hardware, through a Hypervisor.

- it emulates an os inside the VM and tightens the components toghether. can run multiple VMs in it. each server in a data center has a hypervisor.

## What is the Azure portal?
The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can:

Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

## What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

There are three deployment models for cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.

| Deployment model  |         Description |
|-------------------|---------------|
|Public cloud       |Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet.|
|Private cloud       | A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. |
|Hybrid cloud|A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. |

## Cloud model comparison

- Public cloud:
  
  - No capital expenditures to scale up.
  - Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
  - Organizations pay only for what they use.

- Private cloud:
  
  - Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
  - Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
  - Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.
- Hybrid cloud:
  
  - Provides the most flexibility.
  - Organizations determine where to run their applications.
  - Organizations control security, compliance, or legal      requirements.
